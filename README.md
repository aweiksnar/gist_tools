# [Gist Tools](http://gist-tools.herokuapp.com/)

## App

Provides users with stats about their gists through the Github API. Users can log in through Github to view a list of their gists and select the ones they wish to view stats about.

## API Hits

Logged in users are allotted 5000 API hits per hour. Users who just want to try it out can do so on a single gist if any of the public 60 API hits are available (counter is in the top-right corner).

## Authentication

Handled through devise and omniauth-github
